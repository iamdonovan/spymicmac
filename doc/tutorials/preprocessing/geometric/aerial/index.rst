aerial images
=============

Geometric pre-processing for aerial images typically involves identifying the location of 4-8 "fiducial" markers
(fixed points whose location is known) in each image.

For a general workflow of identifying the location of fiducial markers, see :doc:`this page <fiducials>`.

For example camera models and fiducial marker patterns, see :doc:`this page <cameras>`. Note that this page is not (yet)
exhaustive, and it is possible that there are other fiducial marker patterns for the camera model you are working with.
